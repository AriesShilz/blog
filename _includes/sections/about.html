  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hi, I’m Venu!
  <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I’m a Sophomore studying Computer Science at Amrita University, Kerala. Born and brought up in Hyderabad.
  Here’s a quick insight into my life as a engineering student, dev, and illustrator. Who I am, where I’m from, and what I do. I hope you enjoy it! :)
  <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I can code well. Obsessed with a black/green terminal. I like ambitious and passionate people. Food is the love of my life.
  I usually sleep after 2 am. I prefer text/email over a phone call.
  <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I have created this website in order to bring my interests, which I absolutely love!
   I hope you enjoy what I put up on the website – be sure to stalk me regularly to keep up to date! ;)
  <!--<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am looking for an internship opportunity between May-July, 2018. Anything that involves application of my skills and offers me a great learning opportunity.-->
  <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Thanks for taking the time to check out what I do. I hope you find it helpful!
