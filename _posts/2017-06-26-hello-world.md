If you ever stumbled on any programming language tutorial regardless of your background, you certainly have already seen the “Hello, World” written somewhere in the tutorials. As a function, the computer program simply tells the computer to display the words “Hello, World”.

All programmers that have come before you have, at some point, felt the same rush of adrenaline after realizing they successfully communicated through the computer with a huge smile on their face :D. Over the past several decades, it’s grown to become a time-honored tradition. Have you ever thought of how the two most famous words in the history of programming first began:

**Where does ‘Hello, World’ come from?**

“Hello, World” was created by [Brian Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan), author of one of the most widely read programming books: C Programming Language, in 1978. He first referenced ‘Hello World’ in the C Programming Language book’s predecessor: A Tutorial Introduction to the Programming Language B published in 1973.
```
main(){
extrn a,b,c;
putchar(a); putchar(b); putchar(c); putchar('!*n');
}

a 'hell';
b 'o, w';
c 'orld';
```
Unfortunately, the legend himself can’t definitely pinpoint when or why he chose the words “Hello, World.” When asked what sparked the idea for the name “Hello, World” in an interview with [Forbes India](http://forbesindia.com/interview/special/brian-kernighan-no-one-thought-c-would-become-so-big/29982/1#ixzz20uGsw1jH), he said his memory’s dim. “What I do remember is that I had seen a cartoon that showed an egg and a chick and the chick was saying, “Hello, World.”

It’s pretty fitting, considering “Hello, World” represents the birth of computer programming as a widespread phenomenon for the masses.

Although no one can scientifically explain why “Hello, World” grew to become wildly popular, “Hello, World” program marks a major change in the historical rhetoric of programming. Let us look at these "Hello, World" 's. You will find few codes really interesting...
