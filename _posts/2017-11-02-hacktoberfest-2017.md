Hello Folks,

I am back with one more blog post in which I will let you know what I did in this October in which I took a step, Making my first PR 🙌🎉

#### What is Hacktoberfest?

Celebrate open source this October by participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), a month-long festival of code organized by our friends at DigitalOcean and hosted on GitHub.

To participate, simply open a pull request and contribute to any open source project. You can fix a bug, add a feature, or even improve some documentation. If you make four pull requests by October 31st, you’ll get the satisfaction of sharing your code with the world—and a t-shirt and some cool stuff, of course.

#### What I did?

Now I will tell what all things I did. After registering I was searching for some good projects to contribute to, then I found this repository [Hidden Courses in Codecademy](https://github.com/hiddencodecademy/hiddencodecademy.github.io). The basic idea was simple and straight “*Here you will find a collection of hidden courses on Codecademy which are not visible in the dashboard of the official Codecademy website.*”

But the main issue, the web page sucks. The main motto was to develop the page into a good and attractive page.

Along with few members, I was involved in this project to make it attractive, responsive and also to add more links to the page. I worked for almost three days making various changes in it, also discussing with the team about more more isuues. By the way, I completed my four PRs in this project itself. All the PR of mine to this project got merged and I am happy about that. 😁

Apart from this project, I contributed to Moz-NIEC organization also. The interesting part is here I was talking about this Hacktoberfest with my friend and I posted my WhatsApp status with the contributions I made with the caption “looking forward”. The very next day, I got a mail from DigitalOcean offering me goodies as I completed the Hacktoberfest succesfully. *Time to celebrate  🍾🍻*

Finally, I am happy to say that this is my first step to OpenSource and Hacktoberfest made it easy and delightful. 😊

Happy Hacking!!
