Hello there,

Today I had to remember what I did during my summer vacation as I have to send my (late) vacation status update. Hmmm, What I did ? ü§îüòë

Haa, I enjoyed this summer also as usual with little bit of working. I visited my native village which I do every year. Also I learnt JavaScript in addition to HTML and CSS.

I created a Wordpress blog (Yes!! you are now reading it üòÅ) and also I tried to create my own portfolio page which I completed later. For that I chose Github pages and in this blog post I want tell about it (in brief).
<h3 id="github--github-pages-">GitHub & GitHub Pages</h3>
<em>GitHub Pages</em> is a free place to store the files that run a website and host that website for people to visit (it only works for particular types of website, like basic HTML sites or Jekyll sites, and does not host databases).

<em>GitHub</em> is a visual way to use <em>git</em>, a system for <em>versioning</em>: keeping track of changes to computer files (including code and text documents) over time (as explained above). If you‚Äôre curious, here‚Äôs a friendly lesson for exploring GitHub.

Okay, here is the link to my portfolio page <a href="https://vchrombie.github.io/" target="blank" rel="noopener">vchrombie.github.io</a>.
<h3 id="why-github">Why Github?</h3>
Because it‚Äôs easy and free. And if you don‚Äôt like Github, you can take the exact code you‚Äôve produced and put it anywhere else that acts as a web server. The important thing is: if you <em>do</em> want to learn web development, how to use Git, how to use Github, how to program, and so forth, this lesson provides a stepping-stone to those concepts as well as a canvas to practice on. And even if you don‚Äôt want to learn anything, you can come away with something useful: a customized web homepage that you can maintain yourself.
