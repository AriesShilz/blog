Hello,

I am back with one more short update of the work for the week 4. Throughout this week, I was working exclusively for tvseries projects and I happy to say that I was able to add two more series to the existing project.

As I was successful in adding a series in the previous week and I became familiar with the codebase and it made this task a bit easier than before. I added Supernatural and The Big Bang Theory to the project.

I added The Big Bang theory with reference to the Pull Request [#55](https://github.com/athityakumar/tvseries/pull/55)

I took this screenshot while I was testing my code and meanwhile I was uploading all my code to the github.
