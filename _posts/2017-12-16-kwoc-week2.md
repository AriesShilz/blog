Hello Buddies,

I am back with one more status update. One more week ended and it‚Äôs time to share my work with you people.

So, it is the second week and I am focusing on my main projects instead of taking simple issues from other projects.

### > [Parth-Vader/YoutubeDataCollector](https://github.com/Parth-Vader/YoutubeDataCollector)  üëÄ

Okay, I was really interested in this project as I want to create a chrome extension (have a different idea) and contributing to this project may help to my project. Moreover, this project has a very good idea. This project is a Chrome Extension which stores all the data of the Youtube Videos you have watched recently.

So, for getting started I need to learn how a chrome extension is actually built and how it works. So, I surfed over the some websites to get this information and then I was ready to contribute.I modified the page a bit and added an youtube link to the chrome extension so that one can go directly to the Youtube from the extension itself. Also I came with a new logo for the project. As it deals with Youtube and History, I created a new logo for the same. I made many changes to the README also.

So, a total of [17 commits](https://github.com/Parth-Vader/YoutubeDataCollector/commits?author=vchrombie&since=2017-11-30T18:30:00Z&until=2017-12-28T18:30:00Z) for two issues [Add a suitable favicon #6](https://github.com/Parth-Vader/YoutubeDataCollector/issues/6) and [Beautify readme #7](https://github.com/Parth-Vader/YoutubeDataCollector/issues/7). I gave two Pull Requests for these two issues [#8](https://github.com/Parth-Vader/YoutubeDataCollector/pull/8), [#9](https://github.com/Parth-Vader/YoutubeDataCollector/pull/8). Happily, both of them got merged.

This project is one of the main projects which I took very seriously. Since it is a webapp, I thought contribution to this will help me in the future. It is like a normal video player which plays only online youtube videos but it‚Äôs key feature is it‚Äôs speed. It is comparatively fast than Youtube. You can check out this here, [fast_playlist](https://udiboy1209.github.io/fast_playlist/).

So, with reference to this issue [Implement shuffle feature #12](https://github.com/udiboy1209/fast_playlist/issues/12), I started working on this app. The task was to implement a shuffle feature in this webapp like that of the shuffle feature in music player apps. Initially, I searched for some solutions and I decided to use [Fisher-Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) algorithm here. It was relatively tuff as I have to understand the codebase and I have to figure it out where the algorithm goes.

But later on, I found a small trick which can somewhat solve this issue and I submitted a PR [#22](https://github.com/udiboy1209/fast_playlist/pull/22/). I actually changed *playNext()* and *playPrev()* functions for making it simple without integrating with the algorithms. But my mentor was not satisfied with this. You can see the [conversation](https://github.com/udiboy1209/fast_playlist/pull/22) and get some clear idea over it. So, the PR was left un-merged and I am currently working with that implementation.

Hope I will do it soon!

There is another project for which I am continously working on. The project is [athityakumar/tvseries](https://github.com/athityakumar/tvseries). The main barrier is the project itself has a lot of bugs which I will discussing in the next blog post and it requires some serious debugging and a lot of time and patience. Hope I will do that by the next week.

Cheers!!
